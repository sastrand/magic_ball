## Magic K-nary Ball

This repo is a demonstration of how to build a package in Python.

Like a magic eight ball, this command line application will offer answers to any question (or string of characters) you hand it.

The ball currently offers two answer possibilities: yes or no. It can be extended to offer arbitrarily many answers.

The same question asked more than once will always receive the same answer.
